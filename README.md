# Summary 

In this project, I made a Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) about students' performance in Technical Drawing disciplines from a Brazilian University.

# Motivation

Get a better understanding of how Technical Drawing disciplines are going in the past few years, with focus on students' performance and dropouts.

# Tools 

I used R language and RStudio IDE to perform all analysis.

Some statistics used: aov, shapiro test, levene test, kruskal wallis test, multiVDA and duncan test.

# What is data about?

The data is about students from Technical Drawing disciplines from a Brazilian University. 

# What data is available?

Two different datasets were provided:

1- Student data separated by undergraduating course, from all professors (without the information about who ministered the discipline).

2- Students data from one specific professor from Technical Drawing I and II.

# How to use?

You can clone/download/fork the project and use for your own goals. 

- **R**: has all source code used for this analysis;
- **csv**: has source data;
- **fonts**: has some specific fonts used in some figures generated from source code;
- **images**: has all images generated from this analysis;
